        <p>At any given time on board the space station, a large array of different experiments are underway within a
          wide range of disciplines. These experiments are selected by each space station partner to meet the goals of
          each respective agency. Here, you can search the Space Station Research Explorer database of experiments to
          learn more about each experiment’s objectives, descriptions, and results, as well as on-board facilities,
          imagery and additional information that may be found beyond this database.</p>

        <h2>Biology and Biotechnology</h2>
        <p>In microgravity, controls on the directionality and geometry of cell and tissue growth can be dramatically
          different to those on Earth. Various experiments have used the culture of cells, tissues and small organisms
          on orbit as a tool to increase our understanding of biological processes in microgravity.</p>
        <h2>Earth and Space Science</h2>
        <p>The presence of the space station in low-Earth orbit provides a unique vantage point for collecting Earth and
          space science data. From an average altitude of about 400 km, details in such features as glaciers,
          agricultural fields, cities, and coral reefs taken from the ISS can be layered with other sources of data,
          such as orbiting satellites, to compile the most comprehensive information available.</p>
        <h2>Educational Activities</h2>
        <p>The space station provides a unique platform for inspiring students to excel in mathematics and science.
          Station educational activities have had a positive impact on thousands of students by involving them in
          station research, and by using the station to teach them the science and engineering that are behind space
          exploration.</p>
        <h2>Human Research</h2>
        <p>The space station is being used to study the risks to human health that are inherent in space exploration.
          Focal research questions address the mechanisms of the risks and develop test countermeasures to reduce these
          risks. Research on space station addresses the major risks to human health from residence in a long-duration
          microgravity environment. Results from this research are key enablers for future long-duration missions beyond
          low Earth orbit.</p>
        <h2>Physical Science</h2>
        <p>The space station provides the only place to study long-term physical effects in the absence of gravity. This
          unique microgravity environment allows different physical properties to dominate systems, and these have been
          harnessed for a wide variety of physical sciences.</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Studies on the space station can test a variety of technologies, systems, and materials that will be needed
          for future long-duration exploration missions.</p>

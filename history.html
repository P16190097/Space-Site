        <h1 class="page-header">History of the International Space Station</h1>
        <p>The International Space Station (ISS) took 10 years and more than 30 missions to assemble. It is the result
          of unprecedented scientific and engineering collaboration among five space agencies representing 15 countries.
          The space station is approximately the size of a football field: a 460-ton, permanently crewed platform
          orbiting 250 miles above Earth. It is about four times as large as the Russian space station Mir and five
          times as large as the U.S. Skylab.</p>
        <p>The idea of a space station was once science fiction, existing only in the imagination until it became clear
          in the 1940s that construction of such a structure might be attainable by our nation. As the Space Age began
          in the 1950s, designs of “space planes” and stations dominated popular media. The first rudimentary station
          was created in 1969 by the linking of two Russian Soyuz vehicles in space, followed by other stations and
          developments in space technology until construction began on the ISS in 1998, aided by the first reusable
          spacecraft ever developed: the American shuttles.</p>
        <p>Until recently, U.S. research space onboard the ISS had been reserved for mostly government initiatives, but
          new opportunities for commercial and academic use of the ISS are now available, facilitated by the ISS
          National Lab.</p>
